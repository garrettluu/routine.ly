## Inspiration
Quarantine = no routine, making it harder to get things done and stay productive. Routine.ly is a simple todo-list app that encourages you to get things done!

## How I built it
Designed the UI using **Figma**, then used **Flutter** to code it. Also used **Firebase** as a back-end to store and retrieve tasks.

## Challenges/Accomplishments
I worked alone on this project so the time constraint was difficult to work with, so I scaled the project down to a basic CRUD app to make it manageable within the time. However, I think I did pretty well in starting a project and creating a framework for a more complex application in the future.

## What I learned
Flutter. Is. Cool!

(also F i r e b a s e I guess)

## What's next for routine.ly
Integration with Google Calendar to schedule times for tasks, and split up large tasks into daily sections.
