A todo-list app originally made at Hack at Home 2020.

### Running the app

Make sure you have Flutter installed before continuing. If you don't,
go to this site and follow the instructions for your operating system:

https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install

Open the terminal in the root directory of the project and type
`flutter run` while you have an Android device connected (iOS is
currently not supported). Wait for the compiler to finish building,
and now your app is ready!

Any changes made while the app is running will dynamically change the
app, so no need to recompile everything.

### Planned Features

- Google Calendar integration to allow for planning of tasks
- Notifications with Firebase Cloud Messaging
- Other sign-in methods
